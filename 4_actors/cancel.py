# cancel.py
#
# As currently implemented, actors can be created, but there
# is no way for an actor to terminate and go away.  Your
# task in this project is to formulate some kind of approach
# to actor cancellation.  However, there's a twist.
#
# In our actor system, the *ONLY* operation allowed on an actor is the
# act of sending it a message.  You are *NOT* allowed to add new
# methods to the Actor class.
#
# To start, code from `actors.py` is copied below.  As with other
# exercises, you may be modifying parts of this code.   You
# are not using code from earlier exercises as this is a separate
# concern.

# Exercise 9
#
# Your task is to implement an approach to actor cancellation.  There are
# a few requirements:
#
#   - Actors must be able to self-cancel.
#   - There must be a way to request cancellation from outside. 
#   - Actors must be able to detect if they are being cancelled.
#
# In implementing these requirements, you are *NOT* allowed to modify
# the `Actor` class.   You may modify parts of the Manager.
#
# The following example and test illustrates the requirements.

class SelfCancel(Actor):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        
    def handle_message(self, msg: Message):
        if self.n == 0:
            # Cancel myself. Somehow.
            assert False, 'TODO'
        else:
            self.n -= 1
            print('Received:', msg)

class OtherCancel(Actor):
    def handle_message(self, msg: Message):
        if cancelled:          # MUST FIX
            print('I was cancelled')
        else:
            print('Received:', msg)


def test_cancel():
    m = Manager()
    m.spawn('self', SelfCancel(2))
    m.spawn('other', OtherCancel())
    print('Testing self-cancel')
    m.send(Message(source='test',
                   dest='self',
                   content='T-minus 2'))
    m.send(Message(source='test',
                   dest='self',
                   content='T-minus 1'))
    print('self should cancel')
    m.send(Message(source='test',
                   dest='self',
                   content='T-minus 0'))
    print('Should have seen a message about SelfCancel "going away"')
    # This message should not be delivered to anything.
    m.send(Message(source='test',
                   dest='self',
                   content='WHY AM I STILL ALIVE?!?!?! THIS IS A BUG'))
    print('Testing other-cancel')
    m.send(Message(source='test',
                   dest='other',
                   content='Hello'))
    print('other should cancel')
    m.cancel('other')
    print('Should have seen a message about OtherCancel "going away"')
    # This message should not be delivered to anything.
