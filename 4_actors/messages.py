# messages.py
#
# A key part of the actor system is the concept of a message.  A
# message minimally contains information about the sender and
# recipient.  This is encoded in the `source` and `dest` fields.
# However, a message also contains some kind of content that is to be
# interpreted by the receiver.
#
# A debate has erupted about the interpretation of the content.  As
# currently written, the content is encoded as a string.  Any
# interpretation is based on string processing.  The following code
# shows an example:

from dataclasses import dataclass

# --- This code is copied directly from actors.py.  You will be changing it.
@dataclass
class Message:
    source : str
    dest : str
    content : str

class Actor:
    def __del__(self):
        print(f'{self} is going away')
        
    def handle_message(self, msg: Message):
        raise NotImplementedError('Actors must implement handle_message()')
    
class Manager:
    def __init__(self):
        self._actors = { }
        
    def send(self, msg: Message):
        if msg.dest in self._actors:
            self._actors[msg.dest].handle_message(msg)

    def spawn(self, address: str, actor: Actor) -> str:
        self._actors[address] = actor
        return address


# --- Example of an Actor that handles different incoming message types.
#     Maybe it's part of a game.

class Player(Actor):
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 0
        self.y = 0
        self.energy = 100

    def handle_message(self, msg):
        parts = msg.content.split()
        if parts[0] == 'move':
            self.x += int(parts[1])
            self.y += int(parts[2])
            print(f'Moved to: {self.x}, {self.y}')

            self.energy += int(parts[1])
            print(f'Boosted to: {self.energy}')

# Exercise 3
#
# It has been argued that this particular design for messages is
# both slow and error-prone.  Consider:
#
#  - The string content is completely unstructured. Literally
#    anything could be encoded inside.  So, we have to write code to
#    parse and validate it.
#
#  - There are many possible message variants in the system. For
#    example, the code above recognizes "move" and "boost" messages,
#    but there could be many more added later. 
#
#  - The message handling code in handle_message() is performing
#    some kind of case-analysis with an if-elif-else statement to
#    figure out what the message is.  This seems like it could be slow.
#
# Eva has suggested that the different message types could possibly
# be represented by their own classes.  For example:
#
#    @dataclass
#    class Move:
#        dx : int
#        dy : int
#
#    @dataclass
#    class Boost:
#        amount : int
#
# However, it's somewhat unclear how such an approach might
# integrate with the already existing design.
#
# Your task: Figure out a better design for messages that allows for
# many different message variants to be supported as well as more
# efficient message dispatching in the `handle_message()` method of
# actors.
#
# You can modify all relevant parts of this file to support
# your proposed redesign including the above example.
#
# There's not really a "right" answer to this problem, but you should
# be prepared to justify your approach. Why did you choose to
# organize the code in "that" way?  Note: parts of the problem
# involve performance. You might try to make some performance
# measurements to justify your choices.
