Welcome and Setup
-----------------

Welcome to Advanced Programming with Python.  There are a few basic
ground rules to start.  First, you need to clone and make your own
working branch of the course materials.  You should wait until the
start of the course to do this:

```
bash $ git clone https://github.com/dabeaz-course/advprog_2025_03
bash $ cd advprog_2025_03
bash $ git checkout -b yourname
bash $ git push -u origin yourname
```

For the remainder of the course, you should do all of the work in your
dedicated branch of the repository.  Moreover, I strongly encourage
you to commit and push the code in your branch throughout the
course. For example:

```
bash $ git commit -m "Solved project 1"
bash $ git push
```

There are a couple of benefits of doing this.  First, it allows me
to see your code and provide assistance. As an online course, I can't
walk around and see your screen.  Thus, you can't just call me over
for a debugging session.  However, if your code is pushed to GitHub,
we can look at it together.   Second, having your code here makes
it easier for everyone to compare notes and get ideas.  From the
GitHub web page, you can select a different branch and view the code.
For example, to view my code, select the "dabeaz" branch.

Instructor Solution
-------------------

I will also be coding everything in the course. You can follow along by
looking in the "dabeaz" branch of the GitHub repo.

Real-time Chat
--------------

The course uses Zoom chat and Github discussions.  Github discussions
is a better option for topics involving code examples.

Zoom Meeting Link
-----------------

The live course is conducted via Zoom.  The official course hours are
09:30-17:30 US CDT/CHICAGO (UTC-05:00).  I will be online
approximately 30 minutes prior to the start time. Here are access

Preparation
-----------

I assume that you already know the basics of Python programming including built-in
datatypes, functions, and classes.  Here's an online course that covers the
basics:

* [Practical Python Programming](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python).

Much of this course is focused on software design and problem decomposition.  The
following talk is an excellent primer for putting you in the right frame of mind:

* [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmSAYlu0NcY)

Projects
--------

The course is organized around a collection of small projects. These
are found in different directories of the repository:

* `0_theater/`
* `1_fracs/`
* `2_portfolio/`
* `3_stacks/`
* `4_actors/`
* `5_elevator/`
* `6_config/`
* `7_interface/`
* `8_protocol/`
* `9_puzzle/`

You will do all of your work in these directories and modify the files
that you find. But please make sure you're working in your own git
branch (see above).

Each project has a short README file that describes the objectives and
additionally includes a bit of information about Python as needed.
