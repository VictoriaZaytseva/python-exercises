#
# Graydon decides that he's going to go visit his friend Fletcher. He
# arrives at the apartment building and gets in the elevator.  However,
# instead of a typical building directory, the following puzzle is
# posted:
#
# Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live here.  They each
# live on a different floor. Baker does not live on the top
# floor. Cooper does not live on the bottom floor. Fletcher does not
# live on either the top or the bottom floor. Miller lives on a higher
# floor than does Cooper. Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to
# Fletcher. Fletcher does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper.
#
# "What button do I press?", he asks.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 1 - Brute force
#
# Write a program that finds out where everyone lives.
#
# To do this, think about a brute force solution. You know that Baker,
# Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith all live on different floors.
# One way to solve it would be to cycle through all permutations of
# the floors and to enforce the various rules as a series of
# constraints.  Print out the solutions that pass them all.
#
# Is there only one solution?  Multiple solutions?  No solutions?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

def brute_force():
    for baker in range(1, 6):
        for cooper in range(1, 6):
            for fletcher in range(1, 6):
                for miller in range(1, 6):
                    for smith in range(1, 6):
                        # All must live on different floors.
                        if len({baker, cooper, fletcher, miller, smith}) != 5:
                            continue
                        # Enforce additional constraints and throw out bad solutions
                        if baker == 5:
                            continue
                        ...
                        # Print a solution
                        print(f'{baker=} {cooper=} {fletcher=} {miller=} {smith=}')

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------                        
# Exercise 2 - Developing a better vocabulary
#
# One of the problems in the brute force solution is that the code is
# messy.  For example, there is the outer nesting of for-loops and
# there are the repeated clauses such as this:
#
#     if baker==5:
#         continue
#
# Maybe the code could be simplified if you developed a better vocabulary for
# expressing the problem.    For example, maybe the above block of `if-continue`
# combinations could be rewritten as follows:
#
#     require(distinct(baker, cooper, fletcher, miller, smith))
#     forbid(baker == 5)
#     forbid(cooper == 1)
#     forbid(fletcher == 1 or fletcher == 5)
#     require(miller > cooper)     
#     forbid(adjacent(smith, fletcher))
#     forbid(adjacent(fletcher, cooper))
#
# where `require()` and `forbid()` are some some functions that you
# define. Similarly, perhaps complex expressions such as len({baker,
# cooper, fletcher, miller, smith}) != 5 could be expressed in a more
# descriptive form such as:
#
#     require(distinct(baker, cooper, fletcher, miller, smith))
#
# Lastly, library functions such as `itertools.product()` might be able to
# replace the outer group of nested for-loops with something less verbose.
#
# YOUR TASK: Create some helper functions such as require(), forbid(),
# distinct(), and adjacent() that help simplify the problem
# specification and rewrite the brute force solution to use these
# functions.
#
# Hint: require() and forbid() are supposed to abandon the current
# search and skip to the next iteration.  However, there seems to be
# no obvious way to stick an isolated `continue` statement inside a
# function.  However, you might be able to emulate the behavior of
# `continue` with an exception.

                        
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 3 - Separation of Details
#
# In the above problem, there are high-level details that we actually care
# about.  For example, the specification of problem variables and the logical
# constraints:
#
# Variables:
#
#     baker = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
#     cooper = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
#     fletcher = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
#     miller = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
#     smith = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
#
# Constraints:
#
#     require(distinct(baker, cooper, fletcher, miller, smith))
#     require(baker != 5)
#     require(cooper != 1)
#     forbid(fletcher == 1 or fletcher == 5)
#     require(miller > cooper)     
#     forbid(adjacent(smith, fletcher))
#     forbid(adjacent(fletcher, cooper))
#
# However, there are also low-level implementation details that we
# don't care about.  For example, the outer for-loop driving the
# search, details related to control flow (e.g., exception handling),
# etc.
#
# Is there any way to more elegantly separate these details from each
# other?  That is, can you make it easy for someone to specify the
# problem at a high level without getting bogged down in
# implementation details of the search?
#
# This is a somewhat open-ended problem, but as one possible idea,
# perhaps the code that generates the test candidates and could be
# moved into its own function.  Perhaps it could generate possible
# solutions using a generator or iterator of some kind. 
#
#    # Invariants (rules)
#    def apartment(baker, cooper, fletcher, miller, smith):
#        require(distinct(baker, cooper, fletcher, miller, smith))
#        require(baker != 5)
#        require(cooper != 1)
#        forbid(fletcher ==1 or fletcher == 5)
#        require(miller > cooper)     
#        forbid(adjacent(smith, fletcher))
#        forbid(adjacent(fletcher, cooper))
#
#    # Domain (possible values)
#    domain = {
#        'baker': range(1, 6),
#        'cooper': range(1, 6),
#        'fletcher': range(1, 6),
#        'miller': range(1, 6),
#        'smith': range(1, 6)
#    }
#
#     # Find solutions
#     solutions = find_solutions(apartment, domain)
#     for soln in solutions:
#         print(soln)
#
# Hints:  You can iterate over all possible values of `domain` using
# `itertools.product()` like this:
#
#     for values in itertools.product(*domain.values()):
#         ... # values is a tuple
#
# You can create a dictionary from values using
# `dict(zip(domain.keys(), values))`

# Exercise 4 - The Elevator Puzzle
#
# While riding on the elevator, Graydon starts to think--"just how
# hard could it be to code an elevator anyways?"
#
# How many valid operational states does an elevator have?  Let's try
# to find out.
#
# Suppose the elevator operates in 6 basic modes:
#
# IDLE: The elevator is just sitting there with the doors closed. There
#       are no pending requests of any kind. It is not moving in any direction.
#
# MOVINGUP: Elevator is currently moving up.
#
# MOVINGDOWN: Elevator is currently moving down.
#
# LOADINGUP: Elevator is loading passengers and will continue to
#            move up afterwards (shows an illuminated "up" arrow)
#
# LOADINGDOWN: Elevator is loading passegers and will continue to
#              move down afterwards (shows an illuminated "down" arrow)
#
# UNLOADING: Elevator is unloading a passenger, but no future
#            requests are pending. If no buttons get pressed, the
#            elevator will return to IDLE when the doors close.
#            (no arrow is illuminated).
#           
# In addition to a "mode", you need to know the following information:
#
# 1. The current floor (1-5)
# 3. Destinations (1-5). The *set* of buttons pressed inside the elevator car.
# 4. Up requests (1-4). The *set* of "up" buttons pressed in the hallway.
# 5. Down requests (2-5). The *set* of "down" buttons pressed in the hallway.
#
# Your challenge: write a solver specification that precisely defines
# all *valid* elevator operational states.   In doing this, there
# are a few general requirements:
#
# 1. The elevator should never move up on the top floor or move down
#    on the bottom floor.  This includes telling the passengers
#    that it's going to continue going up when loading passengers
#    on the top floor.
#
# 2. If the elevator is moving, there should be a reason for it to
#    be moving.  For example, if the mode is MOVINGUP, there must
#    be some kind of pending request on a higher floor.
#
# 3. The elevator should never be IDLE if there are pending requests.
#
# 4. Others????   The above constraints are probably the "big"
#    requirements.  However, there could be a lot of minor-level
#    features concerning buttons.  For example, if the elevator
#    is LOADINGUP on floor 3, the "up" button on floor 3 should be
#    turned off (because the elevator is right there).
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
# The button panels present a special challenge in this exercise
# because they capture the entire state of all buttons pressed.
# For example, possible values for destinations could be:
# 
#    set(), {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, ... {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
# 
# To create this list of possible values, you might find the following
# function to be useful:

def all_combinations(values):
    import itertools
    result = [ ]
    for n in range(len(values)+1):
        result.extend(set(x) for x in itertools.combinations(values,n))
    return result


def elevator_spec(mode, floor, destinations, up_requests, down_requests):
    # Write logic rules here
    require(1 <= floor <= 5)
    ...

elevator_domain = {
    'mode' : { 'IDLE', 'MOVINGUP', 'MOVINGDOWN', 'LOADINGUP', 'LOADINGDOWN', 'UNLOADING' },
    'floor': range(1, 6),
    'destinations' : all_combinations(range(1, 6)),
    'up_requests': all_combinations(range(1, 5)),
    'down_requests': all_combinations(range(2,6))
    }


# How many solutions are there?  Uncomment
# elevators = list(find_solutions(elevator_spec, elevator_domain))
# print(len(elevators), "elevators")


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 5 - The Elevator Testing Challenge
#
# Graydon thoughts wandered to the frequently crashed elevator in his own
# building.  "It's ridiculous," he thought, "that we computer people
# couldn't even make an elevator that works without crashing!"  Thinking
# about this a bit longer, surely there must be a solution.
#
# As luck would have it, Graydon found an open-source elevator package
# on GitHub.  This code can be found in the file `elevator.py`.
#
# The code defines an `Elevator` class that can be instantiated for
# any given elevator state.  For example:
#
#    elev = Elevator(mode="MOVINGUP", floor=3, destinations={4,5})
#
# The elevator has a single public method that handles an input
# event of some kind.  For example:
#
#    elev.handle_event('destination', 2)        # "2" button pressed inside car
#    elev.handle_event('up_request', 3)         # "Up" button pressed on 3
#    elev.handle_event('down_request', 4)       # "Down" button pressed on 4
#    elev.handle_event('floor_sensor', 5)       # Arrived at floor 5
#    elev.handle_event('doors_close', 5)        # Doors close (boarding complete)
#
# There are only 5 possible input events as shown. Each event takes
# place on a given floor.  The "floor_sensor" event only occurs if the
# elevator is moving and only occurs for an adjacent floor (e.g., if
# the elevator is on floor 3 and moving up, then a ('floor_sensor', 4) event
# can occur).  The "doors_close" event only occurs if the elevator is
# loading or unloading passengers on that floor.
#
# Naturally, there are no unit tests or invariants in the code.  However,
# the author is "pretty sure" that it works because just look at it.
#
# Your task: Devise a "testing" strategy based on the idea of a solver
# and decide if you'd actually ride on this elevator.
#
# To do this, you're going to combine a few ideas.  First, in exercise 4,
# you wrote a logic specification function that defined "valid" elevator
# states.  
#
# Second, you wrote a `find_solutions()` function that can generate all
# possible solutions to a logic specification.  Perhaps this can be
# used to create all valid `Elevator` instances.
#
# Third, can you do anything to make a good elevator go bad?  If so,
# it would probably involve events.  So, maybe that suggests a
# possible testing strategy as outlined in the pseudocode below.  Can
# you make this work?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

def test_elevator():
    from elevator import Elevator
    # Iterate over all good elevators
    for state in find_solutions(elevator_spec, elevator_domain):
        # This is pseudo-code.  You have to fill in details.
        
        # Try all possible events on the elevator that can occur in this state
        for event, floor in all_possible_events(state):
            # Create an elevator instance
            elev = Elevator(**state)
            # Try the event
            elev.handle_event(event, floor)
            # Verify that it's still a good elevator using the
            # spec. If this fails, then there's a bug in the elevator
            # software.
            try:
                elevator_spec(**vars(elev))
            except Fail:
                print(f"BAD! {state} : ({event},{floor}) -> {elev}")

# Hint: Make sure you only generate 'floor_sensor' events if
# the elevator is moving and only for an adjacent floor (i.e.,
# if MOVINGUP on floor 3, you can trigger the floor sensor for
# floor 4).   Also, make sure you only generate 'doors_close'
# events if the elevator is loading or unloading passengers.
            
# Hint: There is an even more clever implementation of this idea
# that uses find_solutions() twice.
