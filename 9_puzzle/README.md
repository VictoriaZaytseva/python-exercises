# Defensive Programming

In complicated programs, it is often good practice to program
defensively by adding various checks in the form of assertions (or
program invariants).  In this project, we're going to take the idea of
assertions and expand it into something much more.

Part of the project involves creating a new vocabulary and a
set of tools for specifying assertions.  The second part of
project involves the idea of using program invariants to
drive a search process for program bugs.
