#
# Introduction:
# -------------
# Arjoon is implementing a distributed messaging system for a game.
# The game has a large collection of different game messages that are
# represented by different classes.  When messages are sent over the
# network, they must be serialized into bytes and deserialized on the
# receiver.  To do this, he has decided that each message will be
# encoded according to the following protocol:
#
# 1. The message type will be encoded as a UTF-8 string, terminated by
#    a newline (\r\n).
#
# 2. The message size (an integer) follows and will be encoded as a UTF-8
#    string terminated by a newline (\r\n).
#
# 3. This is followed by the message contents, encoded as a UTF-8 JSON
#    string.
#     
# To illustrate, suppose that the following classes represent a few
# different kinds of messages:

import json

class Message:
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return type(self) == type(other) and vars(self) == vars(other)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'{type(self).__name__}<{repr(vars(self))}>'

class ChatMessage(Message):
    def __init__(self, playerid:str, text:str):
        self.playerid = playerid
        self.text = text

class PlayerUpdate(Message):
    def __init__(self, playerid:str, x:int, y:int):
        self.playerid = playerid
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

# Here's a function that encodes a message according to the above protocol.
def encode_message(msg:Message) -> bytes:
    msgtype = type(msg).__name__.encode('utf-8') + b'\r\n'
    payload = json.dumps(msg.__dict__).encode('utf-8')
    size = str(len(payload)).encode('utf-8') + b'\r\n'
    return msgtype + size + payload

# An example that shows the encoding for a few messages
def example():
    msg1 = ChatMessage('Dave', 'Hello World')
    msg2 = PlayerUpdate('Paula', 23, 41)
    print(encode_message(msg1))
    print(encode_message(msg2))

# Exercise 1 - The recreator
#
# Taking a message and turning it into bytes is straightforward.  However,
# how do you actually get a message back from bytes on the receiver?
#
# Your first task is to write a message creation function that takes
# the name of message type as a string and the JSON-encoded payload
# (as text) and turns it back into a proper Python object.  The
# function should raise an exception if the specified message type
# doesn't correspond a valid message definition.
#
# Recreating a message from data received over the network involves a
# potentially hostile actor.  How do you do it in a way that doesn't
# introduce weird security holes?   How do you test it?
#
# Note: You can use json.loads() to convert JSON data into a Python dict.

def recreate_message(msgtype:str, payload:str) -> Message:
    ...  # You implement

def test_recreator():
    msg1 = recreate_message('ChatMessage', '{"playerid": "Dave", "text": "Hello World"}')
    assert msg1 == ChatMessage('Dave', 'Hello World')

    msg2 = recreate_message('PlayerUpdate', '{"playerid": "Paula", "x": 23, "y": 41}')
    assert msg2 == PlayerUpdate('Paula', 23, 41)
    print("Ok creator.")

    # A message of invalid type
    try:
        msg3 = recreate_message('HackerMsg', '{"x": 666}')
        assert False, "Why did this work?!?!?! Bad creator!"
    except Exception as e:
        print("Good creator!")

    # Message with incomplete arguments
    try:
        msg4 = recreate_message('PlayerUpdate','{"playerid": "Paula"}')
    except Exception as e:
        # Above message is missing fields for x/y.  Could this be caught?
        print("Very good creator!")

    # Message with wrong argument types
    try:
        msg5 = recreate_message('PlayerUpdate', '{"playerid": "Paula", "x": "two", "y":123.45}')
    except Exception as e:
        # The x and y values violate Python type-hints.  Could this be caught?
        print("Excellent creator!")

    # Discussion: Error handling and exceptions.   The above tests don't provide
    # a specific error handling strategy other than a generic "catch-all"
    # exception.   Is this a good design?  If not, what would you propose as
    # a sensible error handling strategy?

# Exercise 2 - The Receiver
#
# To receive a message on a network connection, you've got to write
# code that receives fragments of bytes and reassembles them back into
# message objects.
#
# A common object used for network communication is a "socket".  A
# socket has a method sock.recv(maxsize) that receives bytes (up to a
# requested maximum size).  It returns any data that is available
# (which might be less than the given maximum).  An empty byte-string
# is returned when a connection is closed (meaning no more data will
# arrive).
#
# The issue with sockets is that they present data as an endless
# stream, but are somewhat unpredictable in behavior.  For example,
# there's no guarantee that the `maxsize` number of bytes will be
# returned. So, if you say `sock.recv(100)`, you might get 100 bytes
# of data, but you might get less than that. If you were expecting 100
# bytes, then you might have to call `sock.recv()` again to get more
# data.  A second problem is that there is no "unreceive."  You can't
# shove already received data back into a socket.  So, if you receive
# too much data, you'll need to keep the extra data around somewhere.
# Alternatively, you can try to write your code in a way where you
# carefully work to not "over-receive."
#
# With this in mind, your task is to write functionality that reads
# bytes off of a socket and produces a fully formed Message instance
# using the recreate_message() function you just wrote.  If the
# function is called repeatedly on the same socket, it should return a
# new message each time unless there is no more data or some other
# problem occurs.
#
# A few helper functions have been written to try and make it easier.
# However, there are many "issues" with this code as we'll see.

def receive_line(sock) -> bytes:
    # Receive a single line of data. Or return b'' if the connection
    # is closed before a complete line is read.
    line = b''
    while (c:=sock.recv(1)):
        line += c
        if c == b'\n':
            break
    else:
        return b''
            
    return line

def receive_exactly(sock, nbytes:int) -> bytes:
    # Receive an exact number of bytes.  Or return b'' if the
    # connection is closed prematurely.
    data = b''
    while (chunk:=sock.recv(nbytes)):
        data += chunk
        nbytes -= len(chunk)
    return data if nbytes == 0 else b''
    
def receive_message(sock) -> Message:
    # Receive a message on a socket or return None if no message is found.

    # --- YOU IMPLEMENT
    # Use receive_line() and receive_exactly() to read a message.
    ...

    # Create the result message
    return recreate_message(msgtype, payload)

# To test the above function with an actual socket, Arjoon has written
# a separate program `testmsg.py` which you can find in this same
# directory.  This program must be running in a separate Python
# process.  Thus, Arjoon has launched it as subprocess.  Once running,
# the test connects to it to receive sample network messages back.

def test_receiver():
    print("Testing receiver")
    print("Launching helper program (testmsg.py)")
    import sys, subprocess, time
    p = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, "testmsg.py"])

    try:
        # Wait for it to start up
        time.sleep(0.5)

        # Establish a socket connection
        import socket
        sock = socket.create_connection(('localhost', 19000))
        messages = []
        while (msg:=receive_message(sock)):
            messages.append(msg)

        assert messages == [
            ChatMessage('Dave', 'Hello World'),
            PlayerUpdate('Paula', 23, 41)
            ]
        sock.close()
        print('Good receiver!')
    finally:
        p.terminate()

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 3 - Is it testable?
#
# Think about the testing strategy in Exercise 2 for a moment.  It
# involves a test, but that test involves sockets.  In fact, a
# separate program has to be running to complete the test!  One might
# ask the question if the code is actually testable in any kind of
# easy way.  Maybe not.  
#
# Your challenge.  Can you devise some better way to test this code
# than launching a separate program and using an actual socket?  Perhaps
# it's possible to create a "fake" or "mock" socket object to use
# in testing.

def test_receive_message():
    # YOU IMPLEMENT.
    #
    # Can you write a test for receive_message() that doesn't involve
    # an actual socket connection?  Note: You may need to write some
    # additional support code.

# Exercise 4 - Performance
#
# It has been determined that the messaging system must be minimally able to
# receive and decode 100000 messages per second.
#
# How would you write a test to ensure this and does the receive_message()
# function satisfy the requirement?

# Exercise 5 - Inversion of I/O
#
# Sometimes when faced with a problem, it is useful to "invert" the problem.
# What is the central problem with receiving messages?  In the above code,
# it might be the waiting for data to arrive.  You have to receive from a
# socket, make sure you don't receive *too much* data, and then put everything
# back together.  How might you write the code if you *already* had all
# of the data?
#
# Peter has proposed the following `MessageReceiver` class

class MessageReceiver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = b''     # Accumulated data

    def send(self, data):
        self.data += data
        messages = [ ]
        index = 0
        while (m := parse_message(self.data, index)):
            msg, index = m
            messages.append(msg)
        self.data = self.data[index:]
        return messages

# Instead of waiting for data, this class works by having you "send" data into
# it. The `send()` method saves the data and then returns a list of all
# message objects that it can find.  The central work is performed by a
# parse_message() function that is completely independent of any I/O.  It
# only works on raw data.   Here is the parsing code.   These functions
# are similar to the parsing in Project 6 (config).

def parse_line(data, index):
    # Parse a line of data or return None if no match.
    if index < len(data):
        end = data.find(b'\n', index)
        if end < 0:
            return None
        return (data[index:end+1], end+1)

def parse_message(data, index):
    # Parse a complete message of return None if no match.
    if not (m:=parse_line(data, index)):
        return None
    msgtype, index = m
    if not (m:=parse_line(data, index)):
        return None
    msgsize, index = m
    msgsize = int(msgsize)
    if msgsize > (len(data) - index):
        return None
    payload = data[index:index+msgsize]
    index += msgsize
    return (recreate_message(msgtype.strip().decode('utf-8'),
                             payload.decode('utf-8')), index)
