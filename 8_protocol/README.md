# The Vulnerable and the Tested

At some point, your program must interact with the real world. Reality
is messy.  You may have to perform complex I/O operations involving
files and network connections.  Your code might be accessed by
hostile actors.  There might be performance and timing requirements.

This project addresses these issues, but also addresses some challenges
of software design.  Can you write code in a way that makes it
more tractable to test and verify?

Go the file `protocol.py` to start the project.
