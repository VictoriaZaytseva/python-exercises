09:35:51	 From Jerry Zhang : They're teaching programming in kindergarten now?? I'm so out of touch already
10:02:02	 From David Beazley : Replying to "They're teaching pro..."

Having watched my kids work their way up to high school, it is extremely unclear to me what actual "programming" in the traditional sense it actually is.
10:03:13	 From David Beazley : Replying to "They're teaching pro..."

The attention span of kids is so crazily low, it most seems like it's been isolated "fooling around", but not much more than that.
10:08:24	 From Bryan Harter : Replying to "They're teaching pro..."

Yeah! My wife went to volunteer in the class one day and they were all making this robot move: https://store.makewonder.com/products/dash
10:08:39	 From Bryan Harter : Replying to "They're teaching pro..."

I'll try to convince the university to move to Scratch
10:09:02	 From David Beazley : Replying to "They're teaching pro..."

Ha!   I had a lot of fun doing the Scratch thing at university.
10:10:00	 From Bryan Harter : Replying to "They're teaching pro..."

I'll look forward to taking your Advanced Scratch Mastery course
10:10:30	 From David Beazley : Replying to "They're teaching pro..."

Basically, I started with that under the assumption that most students probably encountered Scratch in kindergarten or something (most had seen it somewhere).  Then, I pivoted into "you're all CS majors so let's build it."   And for that, I launched NetBeans and brought up Java.   "Wait, didn't you all learn Java for the AP Computer Science exam??:
10:10:37	 From Alan Autrand : Replying to "They're teaching pro..."

@David Beazley  To address msg5 can I change the class? Or do you want us to work only within the recreate_message function?
10:11:01	 From David Beazley : Replying to "They're teaching pro..."

You are not allowed to change any of the message classes.
10:11:07	 From Alan Autrand : Replying to "They're teaching pro..."

Ok thx
10:11:50	 From David Beazley : Replying to "They're teaching pro..."

Although---let me clarify slightly.  I don't want you changing the data structure of the classes or the protocol itself.
10:12:42	 From David Beazley : Replying to "They're teaching pro..."

(So, you CAN change the class as long as you don't break it's original interface)
10:17:14	 From David Beazley : A major concern with this first part is exposure to hostile actors.
10:17:35	 From David Beazley : We have no control over the sender or what they actually send us.
10:17:51	 From David Beazley : Could be malicious content.

11:04:53	 From David Beazley : I might add Exercise 4 to this as well.
11:11:19	 From David Beazley : I added an example of dynamic code generation to init_subclass.
11:11:59	 From David Beazley : Replying to "I added an example o..."

There are many opportunities for "wild" programming with that kind of thing.
11:14:45	 From Iwan Sandjaja : Reacted to "There are many oppor..." with 🤟
11:17:55	 From David Beazley : Replying to "I added an example o..."

On the whole... I'm actually a big fan of `__init_subclass__()`.  You can do a lot of actually useful things with that in a way that is actually very straightforward, easy to understand, and not hacky compared to other alternatives.
11:28:58	 From David Beazley : Exercise 3 is actually quite open-ended.  And "hard" if you want to do it in a principled way.
11:33:21	 From Aniruddh Galgali  To  David Beazley(privately) : Hi Dave,
When I try to run the test for Exercise 2, I get a connection refused error. I think the logic of my receive_message implementation is correct, and actually almost the same as your implementation.
11:33:39	 From Aniruddh Galgali  To  David Beazley(privately) : ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 61] Connection refused
11:34:30	 From David Beazley  To  Aniruddh Galgali(privately) : Replying to "ConnectionRefusedErr..."

The test requires that `testmsg.py` be running in the background.  It's possible that that's failing for some reason.
11:34:54	 From David Beazley  To  Aniruddh Galgali(privately) : Replying to "ConnectionRefusedErr..."

Note:  The test tries to launch it as a subprocess.  Maybe that is failing.
11:45:22	 From Aniruddh Galgali  To  David Beazley(privately) : Replying to "ConnectionRefusedErr..."

Ah thanks. Was a path issue.
11:45:58	 From David Beazley  To  Aniruddh Galgali(privately) : Replying to "ConnectionRefusedErr..."

The fragile nature of the test itself is a good illustration of why a different testing approach might be useful ;-)
11:54:03	 From David Beazley : We should try to do this problem in Scratch maybe.
11:55:00	 From Iwan Sandjaja : Reacted to "We should try to do ..." with 🫶
12:38:32	 From David Beazley : The performance testing on this is very open-ended.   If you wanted to try it on a real socket, you could copy the `testmsg.py` program and adapt it into a perf test.
12:38:46	 From David Beazley : (instead of sending two messages, have it send 100000)
12:51:48	 From David Beazley : https://sans-io.readthedocs.io
14:15:03	 From David Beazley : I'm getting this:  baker=3 cooper=2 fletcher=4 miller=5 smith=1
14:15:23	 From Aniruddh Galgali : Yep. Same
14:16:35	 From David Beazley : The thing going on in this problem is related to something that software developers use on a regular basis.
14:17:00	 From David Beazley : Replying to "The thing going on i..."

(and not the elevator)
14:34:35	 From David Beazley : This is maybe slightly related in spirit to that parsing project (Project 6).  In that project, we developed a "vocabulary" for parsing and then wrote various functions that expanded upon that.   Here, we're developing a vocabulary for describing logical constraints and trying to hide details.
14:50:18	 From David Beazley : One thing I'm trying to do is make the code express the problem using the same kind of vocabulary.   Sometimes requirements are expressed in the positive ("miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper" -> require(miller > cooper)).   Sometimes requirements are statement in the negative.  ("Baker does not live on the top floor" -> forbid(baker, 5)).
15:04:07	 From Vedant Puri : I have to head out a little early and I will catch up on the recording later. 

Thanks David for this course! 🙂
15:04:24	 From David Beazley : Replying to "I have to head out a..."

Thanks!
15:39:02	 From Jeff Wang : Heading out early as well and will definitely review all the recordings. Thanks for all the insights David!
15:42:47	 From David Beazley : I might describe this as a much more refined angle on testing.  Instead of creating random elevators, you're running a solver to find known "good" elevators.  In principle, we'd find every one.  Then, we can run tests on all of them.
15:43:07	 From Aniruddh Galgali : I tried forbid(mode == ‘MOVINGUP’ and mode == ‘MOVINGDOWN’) and it didn’t change the number of good elevators. I would have thought that’s an unreachable state. Maybe I am missing something ?
15:43:57	 From David Beazley : Replying to "I tried forbid(mode ..."

Elevator can only have a single mode at any time.
15:44:17	 From Aniruddh Galgali : Replying to "I tried forbid(mode ..."

Ah I see. It’s analogous to the names in the previous example.
15:44:20	 From David Beazley : Replying to "I tried forbid(mode ..."

Right
16:18:50	 From David Beazley : Is it a bug in the code or is it a bug in the spec?
16:47:37	 From David Beazley : I managed to get it down to 77693 elevators. But wondering if it could be lower.
16:49:22	 From Aniruddh Galgali : Reacted to "I managed to get it ..." with 😮
16:49:49	 From David Beazley : Replying to "I managed to get it ..."

Oh. Just lowered it to 31857.
16:52:26	 From David Beazley : Replying to "I managed to get it ..."

Oh. Except that I'm now getting tons and tons of test failures.  Maybe spec is too restrictive.
16:53:05	 From David Beazley : Replying to "I managed to get it ..."

Kind of a weird game being played.
16:53:11	 From David Beazley : Replying to "I managed to get it ..."

Between the spec and the implementation.
16:57:01	 From David Beazley : Think there's a bug in the elevator, but it's a real weird one.
16:59:46	 From Jerry Zhang : {'mode': 'MOVINGUP', 'floor': 3, 'destinations': {1, 2, 3, 4}, 'up_requests': {1, 2, 3, 4}, 'down_requests': {2, 3, 4}} : ('floor_sensor',4) -> Elevator(LOADINGUP, 4, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4})
17:27:50	 From Iwan Sandjaja : I am definitely need to take this course again since the storm incident make my learning experience suboptimal.
