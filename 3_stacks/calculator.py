# Abstraction or Distraction?
# ---------------------------
# What is the actual problem being solved here?  Is the end goal to
# create a Stack or are we trying to create a Calculator?
# Go read the first part of stacks.py again.... wait, it's actually
# all about calculators!
#
# Discussion: Is time spent worrying about Stacks as a separate object
# worth the extra effort?  Maybe not.

# Exercise 7 - Only a Calculator
#
# Define a Calculator class that has the same functionality as before,
# but which doesn't bother with all of the extra stack class code.
# While we're at it, we might as well give the calculator a few
# extra functions like square roots, powers, swapping stack items
# and so forth.  Your class should pass the tests below.
#
# Discussion: One of the core tenets of object-oriented programming is
# the idea of "encapsulation."  There is some high-level functionality that a
# Calculator is supposed to provide.  What happens inside isn't
# supposed to matter--this includes details about how the internals
# are actually put together.
#
# No stack = one less thing to worry about!

# Exercise 8 - The Script
#
# Mel wants to know if common calculations can be "scripted" or memorized in
# some way.  For example, a common task in math class is to compute
# the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle.

#           | \
#           |  \

#           |    \
#           |_____\
#              y
#
# Mel has written out a list of "instructions" that carry out this
# operation, assuming that the values of "x" and "y" have already been
# entered. Could you give the `Calculator` class a "run" method that
# executes the instructions one after the other?  That is your task.

# Exercise 9 - The Code Generator
#
# Everyone knows that normal people want to use standard math notation
# like 2 + 3 * 4.  Can't you make that work instead?"
# 
# Undeterred, you find out that Python has a standard library "ast" that
# can be used to parse expression strings into a tree data structure.
# From there, it's possible to generate stack instructions by walking the
# tree.  For example, suppose you have a tree node representing a
# binary operator like +:
#
#           BinOp
#          /  |   \
#      left   op   right
# 
# You can perform the calculation by imagining yourself at the calculator
# and thinking about the order of operations required:
#
#      push left
#      push right
#      op
#
# The following Python functions perform the conversion of Python AST trees
# to calculator instructions.   However, the generate_code() function is
# kind of messy.  Is there some way to improve upon that giant if-statement?
