# report.py
#
# Ben has decided to write some Python code to manage his stock
# portfolio. The file "portfolio.csv" is a CSV file containing some
# information about his stock holdings (name, number of shares,
# price).  The following program reads this file, sorts it, and prints
# out a small report.
#
# The module `portfolio.py` contains code for reading the data
# and returning it back as a list of dictionaries.  Take a few
# moments to run the program and look at the code.
#
# Upon showing this program to his co-workers, Ben is immediately
# accosted by his decision to directly use Python data structures
# such as dicts and lists.  "You should really use some classes
# or something man" noted Peter.
#
# Your task in this project is to explore this central question:
# Should you use custom classes to provide a kind of data abstraction
# layer or is it perfectly fine to use dictionaries and lists?
# If classes are used, what should they look like?
#
# Most of your work will take place in the `portfolio.py` file.  You
# will make a few minor code modifications here, but the code in
# this file should keep its original organization (i.e., you'll keep
# the make_report() and main() functions).
#
# Continue to `portfolio.py` to start the project.
