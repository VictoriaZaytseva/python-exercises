# Welcome and warmup

This directory contains a "warmup problem" to make sure
everyone has GitHub access, can find the exercises, and is
appropriately setup for editing Python code.  However, the problem
is also just a bit tricky.  One of the main tasks we face in
programming is that of "problem solving."  In solving a problem, it
helps to first understand the problem itself, but also how to break
down a larger problem into smaller more manageable sub-problems.  So,
that's the kind of thinking you should explore here.

I'm not seeking a particular kind of solution, but you
should think about how you'd break the problem down into parts and how
you'd make your code something that could be generalized in a way that
allows it to be easily changed.
